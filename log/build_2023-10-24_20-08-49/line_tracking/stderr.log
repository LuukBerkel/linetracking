[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:19 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgsl.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "gsl", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gsl" with any of
  the following names:

    gslConfig.cmake
    gsl-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gsl" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "gsl_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "gsl" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
